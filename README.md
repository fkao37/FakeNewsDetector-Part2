# FakeNewsDetector-Part2
Part 2 of Fake News Detector, where ML models: Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost, GradientBoost and Deep Learning NN Models: RNN/LSTM/GRU, and RNN/BiDirectional LSTM,GRU layers. CUDA GPU is enabled for model speedup when applicable.  Additional Transformer model is used to summary each article and the models' accuracy are compared.
